10:04    Dad_GT OK. Off the phone.
10:05    Dad_GT I'm taking a pasting in the stock  market. Yesterday was a disaster. Presently, I'm down $13,000+. :(
10:07    Dad_GT I'm up in my currency paper trade to--Nuts! I was up $50, but I've fallen back to $28 with no sign of pulling up. I think I'll find a bridge.
10:07    Dad_GT All because of a Bernanke speeck.
10:09    Dad_GT Oh, the $13000+ is paper trade.
