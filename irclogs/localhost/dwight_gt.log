23:05 Dwight_GT well, tonight was not the victory I had hoped for, he was not ready
23:05 Dwight_GT I'm going to have to be patient and move forward
23:06 Dwight_GT and rely on the Holy Spirit working on him
23:07 Dwight_GT I will move forward with the ministry and just be praying he becomes willing to take a stand in those areas. This is a learning process for me especially.

10:04 Dwight_GT Hi Harlan. Susan is still paralyzed. She was struck down in Indiana when they resisted God's call to go to Texas and was paralyzed for many weeks. After intense prayer over her she gained her voice back and said they would go where God sent them no matter what.
10:05 Dwight_GT at the ER on Monday night they did not find anything wrong with Susan
10:05 Dwight_GT but her heart rate and blood pressure did come down
10:07 Dwight_GT Last night it was painful to see her being tormented and used, but that is all linked to Kevin and it is not going to be an easy process

10:42 Dwight_GT yes, he is
10:42 Dwight_GT and he is getting very desperate before God
10:43 Dwight_GT but it is still not going to be an immediate quick process
