01:44  mobyduck good morning
01:45  mobyduck I just read an article about ArkOS and became a bit curious about the project
03:46  mobyduck ... I'm guessing most participants in this channel are americans, judging by the activity level at this hour :)
04:50  mobyduck hey pasevin
04:50  pasevin hi
04:51  mobyduck I stumbled in here after reading an article about arkos. Thought I should see what the community is like
05:33  mobyduck woo! more joins! The place is coming to life :)
07:33       jhar Hi all, I recently saw the twit.tv interview and was intrigued with the arkOS concept
07:34       jhar I checked out the roadmap.  Has the email server been selected?
08:30  arkOS_Github [genesis] thomasklokosch opened issue #204: Wordpress install fails with name "test" http://git.io/oZxlTw

09:46  arkOS_Github genesis/master 2cd27f8 peakwinter: add stuff to fm
11:25  devil__ peakwint1: hi Jacob, Linux User Magazine in May will focus on 'secure cloud', so I will update my article on arkOS for them. it will be released in DE and a months later in US,GB. I will have to deliver until March 18th.
11:25  devil__ can you tell me briefly, where genesis will be at that point?
11:26 @peakwint1 hi devil__ one second
11:26  devil__ yes, I need to be in the kitchen anyways for a moment
11:27 @peakwinter devil__ it will be just after version 0.5 is released
11:27 @peakwinter devil__ which means email support, a much better filesystem and file manager framework
11:27 @peakwinter devil__ more general stability and a new visual style
11:27 @peakwinter devil__ and maybe even a mobile interface, who knows :)
11:32  devil__ ok, thanks, so I know what to look out for
11:32  devil__ I will ask you again when I start writing
11:38  mobyduck I'm curious about arkOS. Mainly because I have a raspberry pi and have pondered setting it up as storage, cloud and web server anyway
11:39  mobyduck what's the gain when choosing arkOS instead of installing applications on top of raspbian?
11:40  mobyduck for a semi-advanced linux user such as myself
11:56 @peakwinter devil__: ok sounds good
11:56 @peakwinter hi mobyduck
11:56 @peakwinter the aim for using arkOS is a) being able to get starting with hosting much faster, and b) being able to do it easier without having to mess around with the command line
11:57 @peakwinter so it's just a question of if one of those applies to you :)
12:03  mobyduck the first one definitely applies :)
12:04  mobyduck I lack knowledge about firewalls, iptables and smtp servers, too
12:05 @peakwinter mobyduck: ok :)
12:06 @peakwinter mobyduck: the idea with arkOS is that you wont need to worry that it is Arch-based and you are more comfortable with debian
12:06 @peakwinter b/c terminal is supposed to be rarely used anyway
12:06 @peakwinter like a desktop PC for most people
12:06  mobyduck nice
12:07  mobyduck does it handle e-mail yet? (roundcube or similar, I mean)
12:07 @peakwinter not quite yet
12:07 @peakwinter basic email support will be coming within the next few weeks
12:08 @peakwinter right now im working on making the existing features more stable and getting file transfers / filesystems to work before taking up email
12:08 @peakwinter (just so that websites can be more or less "done" in my mind)
12:13  arkOS_Github [genesis] encinas opened issue #207: Crash while updating network settings - switch from dhcp to static http://git.io/aYYkow
12:36  mobyduck peakwinter: how would I go about if I wanted to help (and presumably found the time to do so)?
12:36 @peakwinter mobyduck: just depends on what your talents are :) you can ask me in IRC or via email <jacob@citizenweb.is> and i'd be happy to point you in the right direction
12:47  mobyduck how big is the focus on non-raspi platforms?
12:48  mobyduck it's primarily a raspberry pi distribution, right?
12:50  Gareth peakwinter: watching your FLOSS Weekly apperance now, sending you an email with an invitation for ArkOS to SCALE.
12:51 @peakwinter Gareth: Thanks! I'll take a look
12:51 @peakwinter mobyduck: nonexistent as of yet
12:51 @peakwinter mobyduck: though multiplatform is coming soon
12:51 @peakwinter mobyduck: i just wanted to start with one platform than gradually work out, rather than start off with too much to chew :)
12:53  mobyduck good thinking :)
12:54  Gareth peakwinter: I assume info@ goes to you?
12:55 @peakwinter Gareth: correct
12:57  Gareth peakwinter: perfect.  on its way.
12:59  mobyduck bedtime now. I'll check back in some other day :)
13:03 @peakwinter ok see you soon!
13:17  ron___ hi everyone
13:17 @peakwinter hi ron__ :)
13:18  ron___ somebody knows about problems witht he arkOS OS X installer?
13:18  ron___ hi peakwinter ^^
13:19 @peakwinter i would know
13:19 @peakwinter what problems in particular ron__ ?
13:29  ron___ when executing it
13:29  ron___ it brings an error
13:29  ron___ arkOS Installer error
13:30  ron___ and from that on, the computer gets like collapsed, and need to restart the computer in order to keep working well
13:30 @peakwinter hm
13:30 @peakwinter what operating system are you using it on?
13:31  ron___ i have just tryed also the debian installer ina a virtual kali linux machine and also brings an error T.T
13:31  ron___ mac OS X mavericks
13:31  ron___ and just tried kali linux too for the debian installer
13:32 @peakwinter yes i've heard of some errors with mavericks
13:32  ron___ on OS X, when the installer crashes, the console starts to bring on warnings like this one
13:32 @peakwinter was it the exact same error in debian?
13:32  ron___ 15/01/2014 19:49:48.002 com.apple.IconServicesAgent[212]: Failed to write file /var/folders/v4/_f1d_0sd4sg1rlvpwh692pdm0000gn/T/com.apple.IconServices/314BB246F94CB431F6F70C96B7EDDEC2.iscachebmp.tmp to cache.     1   IconServices                        0x00007fff8e102b85 ___ZN18IconImageGenerator4mainEv_block_invoke7 + 634     2   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00007fff894d32ad _dispatch_client_callout + 8     3   libdispatch.dyl
13:32  ron___ one moment i copy it
13:34 @peakwinter ok
13:34 @peakwinter you can put it into a pastebin if it is big, so that we don't spam the chat :)
13:35  ron___ its not big but the vm doesnt let me copy, ill type it xD
13:35 @peakwinter kk
13:36  ron___ GDBus.Error:org.getk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._pk_5ftransaction_5ferror.Code4:SimulateInstallFiles not supported by backend
13:37  ron___ it brings it as an unknown error
13:38 @peakwinter if you can run it in your console, with `sudo arkos-install` it might give you a better error message
13:39 @peakwinter please let me know if that works
13:39  ron___ okay ill try
13:39  ron___ thanks ^^
13:43  ron___ aff, in kali linux the problem is python netifaces is not installed
13:43  ron___ maybe its that too what happens in OS X? i tried a couple of months ago the latest version and it worked without problems :S
13:44  ron___ i though python netifaces was only needed por the tar ball for all linux
13:47  ron___ now its working the installed on kali linux
13:47  ron___ thanks for the help ^^
13:51 @peakwinter ok :)

07:59  thomasklokosch Hi, anyone here familiar with the Vagrant Dev setup? I'd like to recreate it so that the genesis app is mounted as a synced folder and genesis included via a git submodule: https://github.com/thomasklokosch/genesis-dev
08:01  thomasklokosch It's not working right now, because the Arch box runs a initial script on provisioning which interferes with my chef setup, I'd like to just disable that script and rebuild it with Chef

16:59  blaaa Hi, Is there some (beta) image for installing arkos on an BeagleBone Black available?
17:00  blaaa I am currently running archlinux, but I read about arkos and I wanted to try it out to see if I can recommend it to some 'novice users'
17:02  devil__ blaaa: afaik arkos currently is still limited to raspi
17:06  blaaa devil__: OK, maybe I'll look into moving it to BBB as well, I believe it's work in progress already. Unfortunately I don;t have a lot of spare time right now...
17:12  devil__ blaaa: yeah, jacook would for sure apreciate help there
17:12  devil__ he is lookong to finish off more basic things right noe
17:12  devil__ now
17:19  blaaa OK, I might get on the mailinglist&I'd have to read up on the current status&roadmap. Also I am still contemplating getting an odroid u3, seems to be possibly more suitable for this purpose. The BBB feels a bit more like a gadget for hardware-related projects
17:20  devil__ I ordered a improv board, should ship any day now
17:26  blaaa I see Genesis will include calendaring/contacts in the future, any details on that?
17:27  blaaa don;t know the improv board by the way
17:27  blaaa there's really some kind of cambiran explosion of these boards
17:36  devil__ blaaa: http://makeplaylive.com/#/home
17:37  devil__ the board has been developed by aron seigo from kde as part of his adventure in developing a free tablet called vivaldi
17:38  devil__ the grat thing is it's modular, you cabn upgrade cpu and ram
17:38  devil__ it's 2 boards in one
17:39  devil__ http://aseigo.blogspot.de/2013/11/introducing-improv.html
17:41  blaaa looks interesting indeed

08:14  orion__ Can I get Genesis running on my Ubuntu VPS?
08:15  orion__ or is it solely supported on arkOS?
09:19  mamoit it's solely supported @ arch
09:19  mamoit orion
09:20  mamoit orion__
09:24  orion__ thats shouldnt be a problem to restore my system onto. do any of you guys run this on openstack? i got a 80 core processor rack im interested in implementing this on top of.
09:25  orion__ if so, how well does it run for you, what usage apps are you running on, etc.
09:29  orion__ and whats the main differences between this and webmin and the like?
09:50  mamoit this is supposed to be a noob proof panel
09:50  mamoit point and click to deploy programs
09:50  mamoit or setup stuff
09:51  mamoit if u have an 80 core processor rack with opentack then I guess you should pick something that's not "noob proof"
09:51  mamoit and more stable!

10:24  orion__ ah sorry multi tasking. ya im hosting sites for a few companies and friends and myself. i just want something thats easy to have them amange it themselves.
11:27  mamoit then turn to webmin
11:27  mamoit or do it by hand
11:27  mamoit genesis is not yet ready for production environments
11:30  mamoit and it is aimed for personal use
11:30  mamoit not saying that you can't use it for production...
11:31  mamoit but I guess it ain't the best tool
11:52  amayer if i install an application like mariadb manually will arkos pick it up and let me manage it?
11:52  amayer manually = over ssh or the like
12:26  mamoit amayer: I don't think so, but you should ask in the forum bbs.arkos.io
12:29  amayer mamoit: thanks ill look into it more. Ive never used something like arkos. and i dont think i want to rely totally on something like it but it seems like it would be a nice supplement to the way i get things done now.
12:30  mamoit for now it is not inteded to be relied uppon :P
12:30  mamoit still in early development stages
14:30  orion__ So i got it up and running on a stack vm. very nice. Im gonna play with it over the weekend and see how many tricks i can make it turn. To whomever is in here working on this: good job
18:25  raspi_user hello
18:27  raspi_user Is there a download link for a .img file for ArkOS? I'm running Windows, and I'd rather write an img file to SD rather than setting up an Ubuntu VM and doing it from there. Thanks.
18:37  devil_ raspi_user: https://arkos.io/downloads/ at the bottom

13:24 @peakwinter hi dbolton_
13:24  dbolton_ hi
13:25 @peakwinter dbolton_: when did you download the Vagrant file from the downloads page? Was it before, say, Friday?
13:25  dbolton_ Yesterday
13:25 @peakwinter hm
13:25  dbolton_ New York mirror
13:26  dbolton_ Happy to download again. It takes about 2 hours though
13:27 @peakwinter No i just wanted to make sure, because I pushed an update on Friday i think
13:27 @peakwinter when I go into the VM via `vagrant ssh` I see a folder at `/home/vagrant/genesis`
13:27 @peakwinter which is why i am confused :)
13:27  dbolton_ under /home/vagrant I have
13:28  dbolton_ genesis-dev.box
13:28 @peakwinter oO
13:28  dbolton_ passwords.txt (I created)
13:28  dbolton_ Vagrantfile
13:28 @peakwinter kk let me try something
13:29 @peakwinter i will download the image and set it up outside of how i created it to see if there is a problem
13:41 @peakwinter hm, it seems to set up properly :/
13:41 @peakwinter did you download that genesis-box file TO a pre-existing vagrant image?
13:42 @peakwinter (dbolton_)
13:43  dbolton_ peakwinter: I was just following the instructions at https://arkos.io/dev/genesis/vagrant
13:43  dbolton_ I've not used vagrant before
13:43 @peakwinter ah ok
13:43 @peakwinter well when you start up that .box file that you've downloaded, it will automatically create a vagrant environment with Arch + Genesis for you
13:44 @peakwinter rather than making a Vagrant VM with arch on it, then downloading the box to it and running that
13:44 @peakwinter does that make sense?
13:45  dbolton_ I don't think I set up a VM ahead of time (unless I could have done that without knowing it :)
13:45 @peakwinter hm ok
13:45 @peakwinter so you went into the windows command prompt, downloaded the genesis-dev.box file to your Windows PC, then cd'ed to that folder and ran `vagrant init genesis-dev genesis-dev.box` etc ?
13:45 @peakwinter (just making sure we are on the same page)
13:46  dbolton_ yes.
13:46 @peakwinter ok
13:46  dbolton_ I have also used vagrant destroy to reset everything
13:46 @peakwinter do you get inside with `vagrant ssh` ?
13:46  dbolton_ yes vagrant ssh
13:47 @peakwinter hm that is strange
13:47 @peakwinter i wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it is on Windows
13:47  dbolton_ maybe
13:48 @peakwinter well, in any case
13:48 @peakwinter when you are inside the VM
13:49 @peakwinter maybe it put it in the shared drive, e.g. `/vagrant` instead of at `/home/vagrant`
13:52  dbolton_ how do I tell whether I'm on /vagrant or /home/vagrant ? (apologies in advance!)
13:52  dbolton_ When I type cd /vagrant
13:52  dbolton_ it gives me the same as cd /home/vagrant
13:52  dbolton_ and ls displays the same files
13:52 @peakwinter odd
13:53 @peakwinter to confirm you can run `ls /vagrant` or `ls /home/vagrant`
13:53 @peakwinter both right next to each other to compare, i mean
13:56  dbolton_ Okay I got the paths sorted out now. (Not sure what I was doing wrong before).
13:56  dbolton_ git remote -v reports
13:57  dbolton_ origin  https://github.com/csnweb/genesis.git (fetch)
13:57  dbolton_ origin https://github.com/csnweb/genesis.git (push)
13:58 @peakwinter ah okay :)
13:58 @peakwinter it should be 'cznweb' not 'csnweb'
13:58 @peakwinter is that correct?
13:58  dbolton_ Sorry, yes I misstyped
13:58 @peakwinter okay
13:59  dbolton_ (Windows command prompt won't let me copy during ssh)
13:59 @peakwinter so if you go to that folder that genesis is in, then run `git pull` and `git checkout master`
13:59 @peakwinter then you check the version number in genesis/plugins/db-mariadb/__init__.py
13:59 @peakwinter is it still zero?
14:03  dbolton_ two files changed with the git pull (plugins/ssh/backend.py and plugins/ssh/main.py )
14:03  dbolton_ But when I log into genesis it still shows MariaDB version0

14:10  dbolton_ no change to the plugin version
14:11 @peakwinter grr
14:11 @peakwinter silly thing
14:12 @peakwinter so what if you try to forcibly remove the folder
14:12 @peakwinter `sudo rm -r /home/vagrant/genesis`
14:12 @peakwinter then redownload it?
14:12  dbolton_ will do
14:12 @peakwinter `cd /home/vagrant; git clone https://github.com/cznweb/genesis`
14:14  dbolton_ Actually I need to start over with a fresh vagrant, since I just tested this bug fix: https://github.com/cznweb/genesis/issues/213
14:15  dbolton_ It crashes every page still
14:16  dbolton_ My goal is to help with testing, but if I become more of a support burden than a help, I'm fine with waiting till the actual release
14:19 @peakwinter hrmm
14:19 @peakwinter its no problem really :)
14:19 @peakwinter just confusing to come up against problems to which i dont know the answer :)
14:23  dbolton_ Question: when you start a fresh vagrant do you have to install mariaDB too? Or is it already installed?
14:24 @peakwinter no, it will already come installed
14:24 @peakwinter all the plugins come installed and at their latest versions
14:24 @peakwinter which is the weird part ^^
14:25 @peakwinter if you test a bug fix and you need to restart genesis (to clear a bug) you can do so with `sudo ./genesis-panel -s`
14:25 @peakwinter instead of reinstalling the whole vm
14:26  dbolton_ good to know. However I was reinstalled the whole vm because the bug made genesis unusable.
14:27 @peakwinter kk well a reload of genesis should fix that in the future, that's all
14:27 @peakwinter and hopefully removing the folder then redownloading will get you the newest version of the mariadb plugin
14:32  dbolton_ By the way I get the following error message the first time I vagrant up
14:32  dbolton_ http://pastebin.com/4NveRUbM
14:33  dbolton_ The new vm still has MariaDB plugin version 0
14:33  dbolton_ I'm waiting for a download from the Orlando mirror but it will take 3 hours
14:34 @peakwinter hrmm
14:35  dbolton_ For this vm I just used the same box as yesterdays download
14:35 @peakwinter just to confirm
14:35 @peakwinter when you checked the version number for mariadb earlier
14:35 @peakwinter did you check in the file itself? e.g. /home/vagrant/genesis/plugins/db-mariadb/__init__.py
14:35  dbolton_ I'm just looking at the version number in the applications page
14:36  dbolton_ I wlll check the file
14:36 @peakwinter ooooo
14:36 @peakwinter ok :D
14:36 @peakwinter this problem might be completely different then
14:38  dbolton_ version 2
14:38  dbolton_ generation 1
14:38  dbolton_ (I don't know if generation is a version number or not)
14:38 @peakwinter nope you are right
14:39 @peakwinter i've tracked down the problem and will have a fix pushed shortly :)
14:39  dbolton_ yay!
14:44  arkOS_Github [genesis] peakwinter pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/kROU9Q
14:44  arkOS_Github genesis/master 76bafb5 peakwinter: fix problem with raising module requirement errors
14:44 @peakwinter i just pushed a change, if you can git pull and git checkout master, we can see if that worked
14:45 @peakwinter to restart genesis after that, cd to /home/vagrant/genesis then run `sudo ./genesis-panel -s` then `sudo ./genesis-panel` and it will show you errors live in the screen
14:50  dbolton_ Looking good.
14:50  dbolton_ I didn't get any plugin errors
14:50  dbolton_ MariaDB reports as version 2
14:52 @peakwinter yay
14:53 @peakwinter this was the first plugin that required a Python module, and the old code from ajenti wasn't transposable
14:54 @peakwinter so that was causing the error, but looks like it works now
14:54  arkOS_Github [genesis] peakwinter closed issue #209: Installing and starting MariaDB causes crash http://git.io/u_ZKVg
14:55  dbolton_ Is this new to the development version: "MariaDB does not have a root password set. Please add this via the Settings tab."
14:55  dbolton_ I don't remember having to set a root password for MariaDB on the release version of arkOS
14:55 @peakwinter yes it is new
14:55 @peakwinter adds more security from the default install
14:56 @peakwinter and will be pushed to the rest soon :)
15:10  dbolton_ owncloud is downloading. thanks for all your help peakwinter
15:13 @peakwinter np :) glad we could get it working dbolton_
15:13 @peakwinter feel free to file new bug reports if anything else comes up

16:38  carlox Anyone have access to a running ArkOS? Just botched my login by editing the user. Clicked the password field without entering anything. From the lack of a cancel button, I accidentally clicked the checkmark. It turns out that is the save button and the Ok button is just a Close button.
16:50  carlox So, I think the web interface chose my new password as "Click to edit" or something similar. But I can't see what it is, since I can't access my Genesis interface.
17:13  carlox Nobody home, I guess...
17:17  rolandx1 try ssh?
17:30  carlox sure I can login with ssh on my admin account as I have added my keys the the admin user. But not the root user. And I need the current password to change it to a new one.
17:32  carlox I can just create a new install or mount the SD-card on a linux box and reset som Genesis settings, but it would be nice to proof a potential bug in Genesis web interface.
22:08  carlox Ok, so after a while I went back to the problem of have unintentionally updated my user password. I reset the Genesis to show the First Run wizard by following this tip: https://bbs.arkos.io/t/noob-error-forgot-admin-password/151 and create a new login with a different username. The I could update the old user. Afterwards, I tried to replicate the old mistake, and yes, it is fairly easy to accidentally set your password to "Click to change". The fir
22:08  carlox time over, I might have added or removed a character before clicking the checkmark, as I couldn't login with this password.
22:14  dbolton_ carlox: It would be good to report the issue (with step-by-step instructions) on the issue tracker: https://github.com/cznweb/genesis/issues?state=closed
22:15  dbolton_ Otherwise it might get lost.
22:15  carlox Yes, thank you!

14:49  dante123 anyone home?
14:50  dante123 I've got owncloud operating under raspberry pi, i made a folder called music_files and have copied stuff there (additional folders and files)
14:51  dante123 however, I think I need to change the ownership to www-data instead of root to be able to access them from owncloud via web browser.  I change the ownership of the main folder (music_files) and click on apply to enclosed files and folders....but it doesn actually do that
14:51  dante123 Any suggestions?
